# Tyler Rudman Portfolio

## Description

This is my Portfolio created with React. This was an extremely helpful exercise becuase it allowed me to use all of the skills I have learned throughout this coding bootcamp. I was able to create an application that future companies can refer to in order to see more of my work. I will continue to build upon this as I complete more projects and add more functionality.
